# AnimeMap

A map of real-world cities where animes are set! This list is hand-curated, it is not automatically made and does not rely on any API. Feel free to fork this repo and do whatever edit you might want.  

The JavaScript part should be pretty ugly as I didn't spend too much time on it, to instead spend more time curating the list.  
<br>
Your help is more than welcomed if you want to add new animes to the list!
- **Requirements:**
    - Obviously, you should give the name of the anime and of the city
    - The anime must take place in the city most of the time
    - The city must be explicitly the same (no imaginated city looking like a real one)
    - I only add the main media (if a series later has movies, I will only add the first season of the series)
- If everything's good, [file a new issue](https://github.com/MartiiDev/AnimeMap/issues/new) and I'll review it as soon as possible!
